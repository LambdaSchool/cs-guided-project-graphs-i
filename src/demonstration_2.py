"""
You are given a 2d grid of `"1"`s and `"0"`s that represents a "map". The
`"1"`s represent land and the `"0"s` represent water.

You need to write a function that, given a "map" as an argument, counts the
number of islands. Islands are defined as adjacent pieces of land that are
connected horizontally or vertically. You can also assume that the edges of the
map are surrounded by water.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

# What kind of graph is this?

# What are the vertices in this graph?
# -- each value in the 2d array is a vertex (think coordinates)
# What are the edges / when do we have an edge? 
# -- edges are mving up / down / left / right between bits of land (1's)

# Start at a 1 (land) and move out in all directions until we hit water
